# Grocery Tracking

This project is a program for tracking grocery items, where the user can search for a specific item, print a list of all items and their frequencies, and print a histogram of the items using asterisks. The program uses a map to store the items and frequencies, and input and output files to read and write data. 

One thing I did particularly well in this code is the use of a map to store the grocery items and their frequencies. This provides an efficient way to store and access the data, as searching for an item in a map is faster than searching through a list or array.

One place for improvement in the code would be to add error handling for user input. For example, when prompting the user to enter an item name, the code could check if the input is a valid string and handle any errors accordingly. Additionally, the code could be enhanced better by splitting some of the member functions into smaller functions. This would make the code more maintainable and easier to read.

The most challenging part of this project was reading from and writing to files, but the project executes this well using the ifstream and ofstream classes in C++. To overcome any difficulties, resources such as Zybooks, tutorials, and forums were used. 

Skills from this project that will be transferable to other projects or coursework include the use of maps, file I/O, and menu-driven programs. These concepts can be applied in many areas, such as data processing to user interface design.

To make my program maintainable and readable, the code is well commented, and meaningful variable names are used. Additionally, the code is structured using a class, which makes it easier to organize and modify.
